# HBA Advanced
Extension built to help users dribble, steal, rebound, and shoot.

1. Paste the 2 DLLs from zip to the dependencies folder of tanji.
2. Install the exe in tanji modules.
3. Open the extension
4. Select the POD that is played with by double clicking it
4. Click Activate
5. Select Set Coords and click the Middle of the field (Keep it checked)(This is IMPORTANT don't mess this up)
6. Defender/Blocker clicks anywhere beside you once you sit on pod it automatically turns off. (Click 2 to turn ON/OFF)
7. Smart passer is if you're sitting on chair and you click 5+ spaces away, it will only put ball there and wont follow it! Check if interested, I personally never turn this on because it is not needed.
8. Auto rebounder is always on! It always sits wherever the pod is dropped, make sure when you AFK or isnt playing to keep it UNCHECKED because you don't want to run in like a maniac.
9. You can click 1 to shoot, it will automatically know to shoot< or shoot> depending on where your avatar is.

Make sure to follow all these steps for the extension to function properly
